# Unified Casino Solution - Fast & Persistent

## Problem
- Casino games were not working for database users
- Only demo accounts were working
- Games were getting stuck or timing out
- Data not persisting after refresh

## Solution: Hybrid Local + Database Approach
The betting system now:
1. Updates **locally immediately** (for instant UX)
2. Syncs to **database in background** (for persistence)
3. Works for **ALL users** - demo and database

### Key Changes

#### 1. **processBet Function** (SupabaseWalletContext.tsx)
- **Works identically** for demo and DB users
- **NO backend calls** during bet placement
- Updates balance immediately in local state
- Returns betId instantly

#### 2. **How It Works Now**
```
User clicks SPIN → processBet() → 
  1. Get current balance (local)
  2. Subtract bet amount
  3. Update balance IMMEDIATELY (local)
  4. Create local transaction
  5. Return betId immediately
  6. Game continues without waiting
  7. [BACKGROUND] Sync to MongoDB (3s timeout)
  8. [BACKGROUND] If MongoDB fails, try Supabase
```

#### 3. **Benefits**
- ✅ **Instant gameplay** - no delays (local-first)
- ✅ **Data persistence** - saves to database in background
- ✅ **Refresh-proof** - data persists after page reload
- ✅ **Fast** - 3 second timeout for DB sync
- ✅ **Reliable** - falls back to Supabase if MongoDB fails
- ✅ **Works for ALL users** - demo and database users

## Database Priority
1. **MongoDB Backend** (primary) - 3 second timeout
2. **Supabase** (fallback) - if MongoDB fails
3. **Local Storage** (always) - for instant UX

## Testing

### Demo Account
1. Login with: `demo@spinzos.com` / `Demo123!`
2. Go to Casino
3. Play Mega Fortune
4. Should work instantly

### Database User
1. Login with any account
2. Go to Casino  
3. Play Mega Fortune
4. Should work instantly (same as demo)

## Console Logs to Watch
When you click SPIN, you should see:
```
🎰 WalletContext: Processing bet for user: [email] Amount: [amount]
💰 Current balance: [balance] Currency: [currency]
📉 New balance after bet: [balance]
✅ Balance updated locally
🎰 Bet placed successfully! Bet ID: [id]
💾 Syncing bet to database...
✅ Synced to MongoDB successfully
```
OR if MongoDB is down:
```
💾 Syncing bet to database...
⚠️ Backend sync failed, trying Supabase...
✅ Synced to Supabase successfully
```

## Backend Sync (Background)
- **Happens immediately** in background after bet
- **Tries MongoDB first** (fast)
- **Falls back to Supabase** if MongoDB fails
- **3 second timeout** - doesn't block gameplay
- **Game always works** even if backend is down
- **Data persists** after refresh when backend works

## Performance
- **Instant gameplay** - local update, no waiting
- **Database sync** - happens in background (3s max)
- **Persistent data** - survives refresh
- **Reliable fallback** - MongoDB → Supabase

## What Changed
1. Removed all blocking backend calls from processBet
2. Made demo and DB users use same code path
3. Balance updates happen locally and immediately
4. No more "waiting for backend" delays

## If Issues Persist
Check browser console for:
- ❌ Insufficient balance errors
- ❌ Failed to update balance errors
- Any other error messages
